<h1>my problem..</h1>


<p>I have been a part of this program,now i am totally stuck at something.

I want to move forward but it looks impossible to get out of this mess.<br>

but i won't give up,giving up is not a solution for me,one thing i have 
learned in this field is that 

you should always keep trying no matter how many times you fail,you will 
eventually succeed and just one success is bigger than a 

1000 failures.so,i will keep trying till i find a suitable solution.</p> 


<h2>my goal..</h2>


<p>well my goal just like many young aspirers in the field is to get myself 
trained enough to get in good position for my career.
