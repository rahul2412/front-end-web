	<p>Lions prefer to scavenge when the opportunity presents itself with carrion providing more than 50% of their diet.They scavenge animals either dead from 	natural causes (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead 	or in distress.In fact, most dead prey on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by the hyenas instead of the lions.</p></div>
